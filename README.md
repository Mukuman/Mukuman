# Hi, I'm Mukund ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia with a strong interest in AI, computer vision, and cloud infrastructure. I enjoy learning and developing new concepts and building practical tools that solve modern problems using anything from machine learning model deployment to full-stack web apps.

Iâ€™ve worked with real-time inference systems in agricultural robotics and collaborated on software projects with a focus on performance, usability, and clean architecture.

## ðŸš€ Projects

### [Maze Treasure Map](https://github.com/Mukuman/Maze-Render-Traversal-CPP-)  
Encodes and decodes mazes hidden in images using steganography and breadth-first search.  
*C++, Image Processing, Custom Data Structures*

### [InsightUBC] 
Analyzes and visualizes UBC course data using a full-stack dashboard with search and filtering.  
*React, Node.js, MongoDB*

### [Digital Asset Manager Associated Engineering]
Worked in a team to develop a web-based image management system. Features include image uploads, tagging, EXIF/metadata handling, user-specific editing workspaces, and integration with Azure Blob Storage for finalized files.  
*C#, ASP.NET Core, Azure SQL, Entity Framework, Blob Storage*

### [Credit Card Default Classifier](https://github.com/Mukuman/Machine-Learning-Classification-)  
Built a classification pipeline using logistic regression, random forest, and SVM to predict default risk on credit card accounts.  
*Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib*

### [SwiftKeys](https://github.com/Mukuman/SwiftKeys)  
A typing game built with C++ and SDL2 where players race to retype sentences accurately within a time limit to earn points. Features a leaderboard, player roster management, and save/load functionality.  
*C++, SDL2, JSON Persistence, GUI*

### [Pet Adoption System](https://github.com/yourusername/pet-adoption-system)  
A relational database model for managing pet adoptions, including potential adopters, staff, and appointment scheduling. Designed with ISA relationships to distinguish between user roles and support flexible queries.  
*SQL, ER Modeling, Relational Design*
