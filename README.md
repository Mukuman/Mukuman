## Hi there 👋
# Hi, I'm Mukund 👋

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia with a strong interest in AI, computer vision, and cloud infrastructure. I enjoy learning and developing new concepts and building practical tools that solve modern problems using anything from machine learning model deployment to full-stack web apps.

I’ve worked with real-time inference systems in agricultural robotics and collaborated on software projects with a focus on performance, usability, and clean architecture.
